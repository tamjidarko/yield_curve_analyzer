Yield Curve Analysis Project 
A Python-based tool for analyzing US Treasury yield curves and tracking key fixed income indicators. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in fixed income analysis including yield curve dynamics, spread calculations, and recession indicators.
 Project Overview
This analysis tool helps understand:
	•	Term Structure of Interest Rates - How yields vary by maturity
	•	2s10s Spread Tracking - The key recession indicator (10Y - 2Y yields)
	•	Yield Curve Shape Analysis - Normal vs. inverted curves
	•	Historical Trend Analysis - Curve evolution over time
Key Features
	•	Real-time Treasury Data - Fetches current US Treasury yields via Yahoo Finance
	•	Yield Curve Visualization - Dynamic plots showing curve evolution
	•	Inversion Detection - Automatically identifies recession warning periods
	•	Spread Analysis - Calculates and tracks key yield spreads
	•	Statistical Summary - Comprehensive analysis reports
	•	Error Handling - Fallback to simulated data for learning
Quick Start
Prerequisites
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance
Running the Analysis
python yield_curve_analyzer.py
Sample Output
CURRENT YIELD LEVELS:
  2Y: 4.21%
  5Y: 4.54%
  10Y: 4.75%
  30Y: 4.80%

📈 SPREAD ANALYSIS:
  Current 2s10s spread: 0.55 bp
  Status: Normal yield curve (positive spread)

What You'll Learn
Fixed Income Concepts
	•	Yield Curve Fundamentals - Relationship between yields and maturities
	•	Term Structure Theory - Why long-term rates differ from short-term
	•	Recession Indicators - How inverted curves predict economic downturns
	•	Spread Analysis - Key metrics tracked by bond traders
Python Skills
	•	Financial data fetching with yfinance
	•	Time series analysis with pandas
	•	Data visualization with matplotlib
	•	Object-oriented programming for financial analysis
Understanding the Output
Normal vs. Inverted Curves
	•	Normal Curve (2s10s > 0): Healthy economy, longer-term rates higher
	•	Inverted Curve (2s10s < 0): Recession warning, short-term rates higher
	•	Flat Curve: Transition period, economic uncertainty
Key Indicators
	•	2s10s Spread: Most watched recession predictor
	•	5s30s Spread: Term premium indicator
	•	Curve Volatility: Market stress indicator
 Current Analysis Results
Based on recent data analysis:
	•	No recession signal - Positive 2s10s spread maintained
	•	Relatively flat curve - Modest growth expectations
	•	Stable conditions - Low spread volatility
Technical Implementation
Data Sources
	•	Primary: Yahoo Finance Treasury data (^TNX, ^FVX, ^TYX, ^IRX)
	•	Fallback: Realistic simulated data for learning environments
	•	Frequency: Daily business day observations
Key Calculations
# 2s10s Spread Calculation
spread_2s10s = yield_10y - yield_2y

# Inversion Detection
is_inverted = spread_2s10s < 0
Visualization Features
	•	Multi-period yield curve overlays
	•	Historical spread tracking
	•	Inversion period highlighting
	•	Professional financial charting
Educational Value
This project is designed for:
	•	Finance Students learning fixed income fundamentals
	•	Python Beginners interested in financial applications
	•	Analysts wanting to understand yield curve mechanics
	•	Traders seeking recession indicator tools
Known Limitations
	•	Uses 3-month Treasury as 2Y proxy (estimated from curve)
	•	Limited to 4 maturity points (2Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y)
	•	No Federal Reserve rate integration
	•	Weekend/holiday data limitations
Future Enhancements
Planned Improvements
	•	[ ] FRED API Integration - Official Federal Reserve data
	•	[ ] Extended Maturity Range - 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y, 7Y points
	•	[ ] Fed Funds Rate Analysis - Policy rate impact studies
	•	[ ] International Comparisons - Multi-country yield analysis
	•	[ ] Forward Rate Calculations - Implied future rate expectations
Advanced Features
